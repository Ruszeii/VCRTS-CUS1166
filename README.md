VCRTS is a system that enables vehicle owners to rent out their vehicles as computational resources and allows clients to submit jobs for processing. 
The system features a GUI for user registration, vehicle management, and job submission. It supports multi-user interactions, timestamps, and a checkpoint 
system that tracks job progress from acceptance to completion. The VCController class manages vehicles, jobs, checkpoints, and a job queue. The project is 
developed in Java, with Git for version control.
